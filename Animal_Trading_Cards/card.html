            <p class="justify">Iguanas can grow from 1.5 to 1.8 meters (5 to 6 ft.) in length from head to tail. The have scales that cover the entire body, 
               with spikes that run down the spine through the tail. The scales coloration allows the Iguana to blend in with its surroundings with a colorful palette of tans,
               blues and greens. They also possess a dewlap that is on the underside of the head running down the throat. Although they appear clumsy they are can move across 
               the terrain at 21 miles per hour. This big guy in the image above was found in San Miguel de Cozumel.
